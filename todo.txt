Support multiple root dirs
Need to implement the preserved tars and the rotation of the files
list backups doesn't really make sense, just make it list files, or call into
it from the helpers so that backups filters on the file names for tar.bz2
or something like that.

Remove the logs config option
Going to need to add mailgun support to the config
Consider the mailgun and template?
Really want to make sure that error handling works well.

================================================================================
X Integrate with ci
X Need to finish implementing the providers.
X Finish list_backups function and delete
X Need to preload the bucket with some sample files
Taking some time to continue working towards next steps
Goal: Actually get a working cli that will do the backup steps seen in backupr
bash.
X * Get the config injected
X * tar the files
X * Validate config with yamale
X * Make sure to implement exclusion_set
X * add encryption
* abstract out provider and implement b2
-> Starting to do this, setting up a test bucket. Don't want this testing as
part of the normal test suite so planning to set up a doit test target for
testing the b2 provider and sourcing the credentials. Need to set up bucket
and config app keys
* Need to make sure provider is cleaned out of the past file after the current
file has been verified with a successful upload
* maintain the scratch space
* would be nice if the notifier could be abstracted like a pubsub and actually
codify this into the python. Want to clean out the last logfile once everything
has been verified as well
* Make encryption optional based on the presence of the recipient
* Test the cli
* Add a test that exercises the actual upload if enabled?
* Start to test the config with pytest
* Integrate with CI
NOTE: Got doit working with pylint, want to run this from a basic action and
publish.

* Test respecting GNUPGHOME
* Test encryption is enabled due to presence of gnupgRecipient
* Verify that backup/ gets created in the log path
* Validate that at least one provider is enabled, and this should be tested
* Validiate that the provider details have been provided if it has been enabled
and test this
